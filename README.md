# Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to analyze and visualize the sales data of Adidas shoes in the USA. By utilizing R for data analysis and Adobe Illustrator for visualization design, the project aimed to derive meaningful insights that could help understand sales trends, patterns, and potentially identify opportunities for growth.

# Data Source
The data used for this project was sourced from [https://data.world/stellabigail/adidas-us-sales-datasets)]. It includes historical sales data for Adidas shoes in the USA, containing information such as retailer, invoice date, region, state, city, product, operating margins and possibly other relevant attributes.

# Tools Used
  1. R: R was used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis. Various R packages such as readxl, dplyr, ggplot2, maps, tidyverse and others were employed for data manipulation and visualization.
  2. Adobe Illustrator: Adobe Illustrator was utilized to create polished and informative data visualizations based on the insights derived from the data analysis.

# Data Analysis
The data analysis process can be summarized as follows:
  1. Data Preprocessing: Raw data was cleaned, missing values were handled, and relevant features were selected for analysis.
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Descriptive statistics and visualizations were generated to understand the distribution of sales, trends over time, popular shoe models, etc.
  3. Statistical Insights: Key statistical metrics were calculated to uncover insights, such as average sales per month, seasonal variations, and correlations between different variables.

# Data Visualizations
The project includes a variety of data visualizations, such as:
Bar charts depicting the top-selling shoe models.
Line graphs showcasing the sales trend over a specific time period.
Scatter plots to explore relationships between sales and other factors like price or marketing efforts.
The visualizations were created using Adobe Illustrator to ensure clear communication of insights.

# Usage
To reproduce the analysis and visualizations:
Clone this repository: git clone [repository_link_here]
Navigate to the R_scripts/ directory and run the R scripts in sequence (e.g., data_preprocessing.R, data_analysis.R) to perform data analysis.
Utilize the generated insights to create visualizations using Adobe Illustrator or other preferred tools.
